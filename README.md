Ciyang's replication of Leffel, Xiang & Kennedy (2016) for LINGUIST 245

## Motivation for study

The study aims to distinguish between two competing theories of the
 semantics and pragmatics of *absolute* adjectives such as *full* and
 *relative* adjectives such as *tall*.

- There are two sub-types of absolute adjectives: *maximum standard*
 (e.g., *full*: a full glass need to be maximally full)
 and *minimum standard* (e.g., *bent*: a bent stick only need to be minimally
   bent).
 Strictly speaking, the study only concerns maximum standard
  absolute adjectives and calls them absolute adjectives for short
  (see footnote 1 on page 837).

- Relative adjectives differ from absolute ones in that they do not have
 maximum/minimum standards (e.g., it does not make sense to say that something
   is of maximum height: there can always be something fuller).

- However, absolute adjectives can be used in an imprecise way.
For example, it is often OK to call an almost full glass "full."

## Hypotheses

The study considers two hypotheses: a *semantic* one (**HS**), based on
 Lassiter & Goodman's (2013, 2015) RSA analysis, and
 a *pragmatic* (**HP**) one, whose semantics is based on
 Kennedy & McNally's proposal (2005) and further developed by Kennedy (2007).

The two hypotheses agree that the semantics of *x is A*, where *A* is
 a gradable adjective, is that x's degree of A-ness exceeds a threshold
 $\theta$.
They also agree that for relative adjectives, the threshold $\theta$ is
 contextually determined.
They differ on the analysis of absolute adjectives.

- **HS**: For absolute adjectives, the threshold $\theta$ is also contextually
 determined.
 Crucially, the mechanism is the same for both absolute and relative
 adjectives.
 Imprecision for absolute adjectives is built in the semantics because the
  threshold is derived to be close to the maximum degree.

- **HP**: For absolute adjectives, the threshold $\theta$ is always the maximum
 degree in the scale. An additional pragmatic mechanism is needed
 to account for imprecision.


## Proposed methodology / design with example stimuli

The study uses the *visual world paradigm* (VWP) in eye-tracking studies.
In each trial, the participant listens to an instruction
 "please click on the Adj Noun" while looking at a scene of objects consisting of
 - a **target**: an object that matches the description, allowing for imprecision.
 - a **competitor**: an object that can be described by the adjective but not the
    noun.
 - a **distractor**: an irrelevant object that can be described by neither the
    adjective nor the noun.
 - a **contrast** (Contrast condition): an object that can be described by the
    noun but not the adjective,
    or a second distractor (NoContrast condition).

There are two versions of the experiment.
In the T<C version, the target's degree of A-ness is lower than the competitor's.
For absolute adjectives, the competitor has the maximum degree of A-ness and
 the target is close to but lower than the maximum.
In the T>C version, the target's degree of A-ness is higher than the
 competitor's.
For absolute adjectives, the target has the maximum degree of A-ness and
  the competitor is close to but lower than the maximum.
(Another way to put it is that T<C/T>C is a between-subject condition, while
  the presence/absence of a contrast is a within-subject condition.)

For example, in the T<C condition, an instruction can be
 "please click on the long line"
 - a **target**: a long line
 - a **competitor**: a long arrow, slightly longer than the target line
 - a **distractor**: a triangle
 - a **contrast**  a short line (Contrast condition),
     or a heart (NoContrast condition).

The dependent variable is how fast participants establish a preference for
 the target after they hear the adjective.
The independent variables are the adjective type, whether there is a contrast
 object, and whether T<C or T>C.

## Predictions

- **HS**: Absolute adjectives should have the same processing profiles as
relative adjectives, because they share the same mechanism.
  + Hidden assumption: for this mechanism, the processing profile will be
   the same regardless of what input it is getting. (This seems problematic!)
  + It is also unclear whether the input (distribution of degrees in the
    comparison class) is equally accessible for relative and absolute adjectives:
    straight lines, closed/flat triangles are very stereotypical.

- **HP**: Absolute adjectives should be more difficult to process when it comes
 to imprecision, because an additional pragmatic mechanism is needed.
  + Hidden assumption: a serial processing model, in which
